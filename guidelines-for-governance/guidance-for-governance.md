# Guidance for Governance

*Note: opinions expressed herein are those of the author and are not representative of any organisation, nor is this legal advice.*

### 1. Introduction

This document aims to provide a set of guidelines for decentralised autonomous governance models. Within this context, autonomous does not refer to 'powered by smart contracts', rather, it refers to the autonomy exerted by any given member of a DAO [[1]](#ref1) (or DAC [[2]](#ref2)) and their actions and/or behaviour at the social layer<sup><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.

#### 1.1 Through The Authors Experience

This section will specify numerous social governance guidelines that could be drawn from in an attempt to create order within a non-hierarchical, decentralised social structure. These guidelines may or may not work and are simply suggestions made by the author and relate to the direct experience of the author.

*Note: some of the nomenclature, terms and ideas may or may not be original. For example, the notion of a reflective social structure may be novel or may not be. Whilst it would appear that such structures may be hierarchical in nature, it could be argued that the reflective properties tied to processes between social groups inherent to the model simply provide the appearance of hierarchy. There are likely many more structural properties to consider that may or may not be responsible for a tendency to centralise or enable the emergence of hierarchy.*

### 2. Properties & Processes

#### 2.1. Structure

Understanding how to best work together as an organisation within a distributed, flat model appears to be quite difficult. This is why you do see hierarchies spontaneously emerge within complex systems (within nature) [[3]](#ref3).

Furthermore, whilst it may also be argued that technological solutions to sociological problems are difficult to find, I would postulate that such solutions do exist (on-chain governance).

The issue that many 'DAOs' (or cooperatives) face is the structural nature of the organisation as it transitions from being 'off-chain' to 'on-chain'. Although a DAO is always going to have an 'off-chain' sociological component [[4]](#ref4), operating completely 'off-chain' would seem to open the floodgates for potential conflicts of interest and centralisation. Thus the following properties and processes may be a consideration for adoption.

#### 2.2. Reflective Social Structure

**Properties include:**

* Maximal Transparency
* Minimisation of Hierarchy
* Power Distribution (or some form thereof)

**Processes include:**

* Joining
* Participating
* Collaborating
* Feedback
* Local Announcement
* Global Announcement
* Collective Publication

#### 2.3. Maximal Transparency

Transparency is maximised, such that anybody within the organisation can see what anybody else is doing, at any time.

#### 2.4. Participation

Whilst participation is not a prerequisite for membership, a participation threshold should be set before a member is given any degree of the voting power.

#### 2.5. Collaboration

Whilst collaboration is not a prerequisite for participation, it should be highly encouraged. Encouraging individuals to work in a collaborative fashion bears benefits such as:

#### 2.6. Feedback

The word or phrase used to describe this quality will likely change depending on the culture that the organisation adopts. For instance, if the maintainers of the Linux Kernel were to form a DAO, they may wish to adopt alternative types of feedback that are much more direct and may be considered to be controversial (see: [https://lkml.org/](https://lkml.org/)). Regardless, feedback, peer review and many other types of constructive comments between members are imperative in order to ensure everybody is on the same page. Thus, communication is incredibly important.

#### 2.7. Local Announcements

Given the structure specified in §x.x, a 'local announcement' would be either an individual or a subset of individuals who are collaboratively working together announcing their plans and/or work-in-progress to the appropriate working group (and thus, is globally visible given the maximal transparency property).

The reasons as to why 'local announcement' is important:

* Enables maximal transparency.
* Opens opportunities for additional participation (otherwise known, at this juncture, as collaboration).
* Enables global or local feedback (from the entire DAO or the working group).

#### 2.8. Global Announcements

#### 2.9. Collective Publication

This can be done 'on-chain' through a consensus mechanism of one sort or another (voting), or it can be accomplished through various types of 'off-chain' social consensus. However, this is the process by which the collaborative work completed by a working group is published by the DAO. Thus, the completed work becomes a product (and is, therefore, representative) of the DAO rather than the internal working group. This is important because it has implications for 'brand reputation' and may affect the value proposition of the DAO itself.

**General Notes**

* Transparency is maximised, such that anybody within the organisation can see what anybody else is doing.
	* Issue: Effective, Intuitive, Free tooling is difficult to find that allows for maximal transparency.
	* Issue: Given the nature of DAOs (and the lack of research on them), current existing tooling may be suboptimal.
* Every member is encouraged to participate.
	* Issue: Incentive mechanisms.
	* Issue: Difference In opinion.
* Every member is encouraged to collaborate.
	* Issue: Incentive mechanisms.
* Members are encouraged to request feedback (peer-review), typically within their own Working Groups initially.
* When a working group is ready, they should announce their work globally.
* When a working group is happy with their work, it should be globally announced and requested to be published by the DAO.

Unfortunately, the general rule of thumb appears to be silence equates to approval. However, it is difficult to make progress, this is why it may be considered better to ask for forgiveness rather than permission (leadership quality), but this simply does not gel within a governance framework. Ideally, we want to minimise conflict. However, simply being agreeable or ‘voting with no preference’ may be detrimental.
